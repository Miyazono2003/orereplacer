xray's nightmare
Ore Replacer
https://github.com/kuohsuanlo/orereplacer

This plugin will change the ore and stone block that is not connect to the air or water when they get broken.

So xray players would think they are getting close to the block.
But after they break the last stone. They would find the ore disappear.

However normal players won't notice any changes since this plugin only replace HIDDEN block.

The probability of making them become ore or stone based on minecraft vanilla setting.
